My data source is located in the Data folder.

To flip the dimensions, simply click on one of the axis. 
To color the lines based on a specific dimension, click the button below the desired dimension.
To highlight some lines, simply click and drag over them and an area will be created across the enarest axis. 

For the hovering I chose to implement a lock system where the first line that got hovered over aquired a lock on displaying its data, and only after that line is longer below the mouse will it allow another line to aquire the lock and display data. This implementation made the most sense as displaying all of the information if multiple lines were highlighted would not work with larger data sets.

I did not implement any extra credit.

This took SIGNIFICANT time to get working due to a variety of different errors and things I had to modify to make processing.js work :(
